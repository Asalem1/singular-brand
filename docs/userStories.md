# Singular Brand 

When entering the field or re-entering the job market as a web developer, UX
designer or creative professional, we are often encouraged to create a
portfolio. Just thinking about it for many can be daunting, especially when you
don't have a large body of professional work to display or discuss. Beyond
thinking about the content, you need to think about how to deploy the site, how
to build all of the core features... blogging engines will only get you so far.

Singular Brand is a hackable CMS made for developers by a developer. It includes
the following modules:

* Blog - Create and publish blog posts by category
* Portfolio - Showcase portfolio pieces
* Resume - A project-focused resume template
* Contact Form - Allow site visitors to get in touch with you
