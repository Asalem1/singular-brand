# Portfolio Manager

An open source platform to host and manage your resume, blog and portfolio.

> I have a personal philosophy in life: If somebody else can do something that I'm doing, they should do it. And what I want to do is find things that would represent a unique contribution to the world - the contribution that only I, and my portfolio of talents, can make happen. Those are my priorities in life.

## Everyone Needs a Portfolio

In her [slide deck](https://www.slideshare.net/AbbyCovert/everyone-needs-a-portfolio-a-workshop) published in 2012, Abby Covert suggested that the best portfolios:

* **Show Pride**, not just proof
* **Tell a Story**, not just a catalog
* **Illustrate Process**, not just passion

Creating a portfolio requires thought, time and attention. Thinking about how to host and manage it should not detract from the primary goal - to tell your story.

## Other Features and Modules

* **Resume** - Manage employment history, skills and projects of various types (work projects, open source projects, community service projects, etc.)
* **Blog** - Create and publish posts. Set draft status and add categories. Optional: provide URL for entries that are cross-posted to another network like Medium.
* **Contact** - Provide a contact form that allows users to connect with you
* **Chat** - Provide an embedded [tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to/) chat widget that allows users to chat with you when you are online
